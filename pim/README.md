# PIM

# Description
The goal was to develop BSH’s PIM (Product Information Management) application so that BSH’s customers could easily access upto-date BSH’s product and catalog information from BSH’s corporate website in different countries and other third-party
applications.
Product Information Data Collection Services are a set of services running as Lambda functions to collect BSH’s consumer product
information in XML format from ERP systems (SAP) and store the data in a database.
In this project (serverless), I worked on lambda backend development.
